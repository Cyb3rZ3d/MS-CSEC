Assignment: Extra Credit | ***Vulnerability Assessment Analyst***


Intro:

This CISA lab will focus on the core tasks of a Vulnerability Assessment Analyst completing a vulnerability audit on the TryCyber University Ubuntu workstation.

Review the pdf `Default Filesystem Permissions and Password Encryption Policy`.  After looking it over, you can begin the vulnerability audit.

For each task within the policy, apply reference matching using the results of each policy check.  If there are any findings, complete a report of the finding.


1. Password Encryption with FIPS 140-2 Approved Algorithm (SHA512) (Vul ID: V-238325
  
   Following the instructions, run the following command using the terminal to check the hashing algorithm that is being used to hash passwords:
   `cat /etc/login.defs | grep -i encrypt_method`

   Per the instructions, a successful confirmation would indicate if the algorithm was set to SHA512.  But it's set to MD5 in this case, indicating this as a finding.

   According to each finding, a report would need to be recorded.  The following is my report based on the finding of the incorrect hashing algorithm.

3. Default Filesystem Permissions (Vul ID: V-238209)

   Instructions:

   Type the following command using the terminal: grep -i "umask" /etc/login.defs

   Reviewing the results and what the policy suggests the permissions should be, it's evident there is a finding for this policy.

   Since there was a finding, it needed to be reported.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this micro-lab was very educational as I successfully learned a core task of what a vulnerability assessment analyst would do in day-to-day operations.  Reviewing policy and reference matches the output of verifying the policy with the technical side of checking the systems, such as filesystem permissions and encrypted hash algorithms.
