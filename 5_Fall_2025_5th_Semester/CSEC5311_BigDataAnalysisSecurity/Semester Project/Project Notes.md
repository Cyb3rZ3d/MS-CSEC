Project Presentation Schedule | 17th April and 01st May 2025
Posted on: Wednesday, February 26, 2025 8:29:41 AM CST

Hi Everyone!

Please take note of your project presentation schedule as follows.

If any of you need to swap your time, you will need to find another person willing to swap with his/her and inform me once both of you have agreed.

Additionally, I have created rubrics for the project presentation and the report submission, which you can find on Blackboard. Please make sure to review the rubrics so that you are clear on the expectations and grading criteria.

You must deliver the presentation and upload your presentation (in .pptx/.ppt format) file, as well as your project report (in .pdf format) file from your OWN account in Blackboard in the corresponding assignment sections.

Project Presentation Rubric:

Merit (40 marks) – Assessed directly by the instructor based on criteria.
Peer Assessment (10 marks) – Points awarded by your peers.
Project Report Rubric:

Merit (50 marks) – Assessed directly by the instructor based on criteria.

Start by figuring out what exactly you want to do—whether it’s identifying co-purchase patterns, predicting product associations, or analyzing the structure of the purchasing network. Once you have a clear goal, explore the dataset to understand its structure and scale, then clean and preprocess it accordingly.

For the actual analysis, you could build a product recommendation system using Apache Spark and ALS (Alternating Least Squares) to suggest similar products based on co-purchase patterns (please do some research on ALS). This would involve training a collaborative filtering model, evaluating it with RMSE, and visualizing insights using Power BI or similar tools. Another option is sales rank prediction and demand forecasting, where you can apply LSTMs, or XGBoost to predict future sales trends based on past rankings, reviews, and co-purchase behavior. You can implement the model using Spark and PyTorch/TensorFlow.

The main focus of the project isn’t just completing it successfully but demonstrating how well you can apply the concepts and tools we’ve covered in class to extract meaningful insights from a big dataset. Let me know which direction you want to take, and feel free to ask if you need any guidance!

I’m currently trying to start my semester project but feel a bit lost over what you are asking of us to do.  Could you further explain or elaborate what you are looking for us to do to complete the project.

My project is:
                
Analysis of Amazon co-purchasing data. You can come up with your own ideas of analyzing the Amazon co-purchasing data using machine learning algorithms. The data is stored here: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html. For example, use clustering algorithms to identify patterns. 
Note: at the time of project selection, please briefly describe what you plan to do specifically.  
 




Using the below details and the uploaded files, create a masters level paper ranging between 7-9 pages.

Incorporate visuals, include figures to only be seen in the appendix, smooth sections transitions providing a brief introduction.
