# Creating a GCP Kali VM

***NOTE:*** Already had an existing project for another class, but for this project I created a new project.

1. Create a new project named `CSEC-5350-cyber-lab-project`

2. Using the `Navigation Menu` select the `APIs & Services` tab.

    - Find, locate, and enable each service API

        - Compute Engine API
        - VPC Network
        - OS Login AP
