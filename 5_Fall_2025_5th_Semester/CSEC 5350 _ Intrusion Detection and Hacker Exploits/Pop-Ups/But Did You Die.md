# Professional Boundaries: What are two actions a penetration tester should never take, even if they believe they are acting in the client’s or public’s best interest?

As pentesters, we're entrusted with priviledged access to a business ecosystem of hardware, network, and sensitive environmental data.  With that said, as I have successfully obtained the PenTest+, I recall some material talking about things not to do such as exploiting systems beyond the scope of permission and reporting vulnerabilities publicly.  

- Exploiting Systems Beyond Scope

    Even if a vulnerability exists outside of the agreed-upon scope, actively exploiting this would violate the contract and trust of the customer.  As an example it would be unethical and out of scope to access HR records during a test when the pentester was only given permission to access a web application endpoints.


- Reporting Vulnerabilities Publicly Without Authorization

    Releasing vulnerability details of proof of concept exploits to the public, even if the client fails to act, neglects the legal agreement.  Doing this could potentially result to data leaks, reputational harm, or even criminal charges depending or locality and jurisdiction.

# Whistleblower Dilemmas: Imagine you discover a serious security flaw that the client refuses to fix or disclose. What are your ethical options? At what point (if any) does whistleblowing become justifiable—and what are the risks? Legal Consequences...?

1. Ethical Options:
    
    - Document thoroughly logging all communications.  Maintain clear records that show responsible disclosure was attempted.

    - Re-engage with the chain of command and escalate concerns through the appropriate channels, stakeholders or legal liasons.

    - Consult legal counsel before taking any actions either with your own counsel or if under an NDA or contract the option to use the company legal team would be a great alternative as well.  


2. Whistleblowing, is it justified when 

    - There is imminent risk to public safety
    - Have exhuasted all internal channels
    - Disclosure is done through proper channels under coodinated vulnerability disclosure policies.


3. Risks:

    - Legal repercussions:  Breach of NDA or CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)
    - Loss of reputation or employment: You may be black listed or sued.  This can happen even if intentions were ethical.
    - Criminal Charges: Unauthorized disclosure may lead to prosecution in some jurisdictions

# Research one real-world case in the last 10 years where a security researcher or pen tester faced legal consequences (charges, lawsuits, jail time) for their actions. Briefly summarize the case and explain what went wrong.

Real-World Case Study: United States v. Justin Shafer (2017)

## Summary:

Justin Shafer was a dental records technician and security researcher who discovered misconfigurations in a dental software database that exposed patient records online. After trying to alert the affected parties and federal authorities, he downloaded publicly accessible files to prove the vulnerability.

In 2017, the FBI raided his home, and he was arrested under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). The charges were based on unauthorized access, even though the data was not protected by login credentials.


## What Went Wrong:

- Shafer exceeded perceived ethical boundaries by downloading sensitive data without explicit permission—even if it was public.

- His communication methods were perceived as aggressive and threatening by the organizations involved.

- He did not obtain legal protection or authorization prior to downloading or reporting the vulnerability.

## Insights:

This case highlights the importance of:

- Following responsible disclosure processes.

- Avoiding direct access to or possession of sensitive data without legal clearance.

- Consulting legal professionals before taking action—even with good intentions.


## Conclusion

As aspiring penetration testers, it is critical that we not only master technical skills but also uphold ethical and legal standards. The trust placed in us demands a high level of discipline and discretion. Understanding the thin line between "helpful hacking" and criminal behavior ensures we protect not only systems—but also our careers and integrity.
