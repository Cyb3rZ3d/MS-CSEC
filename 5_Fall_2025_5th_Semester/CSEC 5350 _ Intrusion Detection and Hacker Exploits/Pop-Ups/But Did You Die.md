# Professional Boundaries: What are two actions a penetration tester should never take, even if they believe they are acting in the client’s or public’s best interest?


# Whistleblower Dilemmas: Imagine you discover a serious security flaw that the client refuses to fix or disclose. What are your ethical options? At what point (if any) does whistleblowing become justifiable—and what are the risks? Legal Consequences...?


# Research one real-world case in the last 10 years where a security researcher or pen tester faced legal consequences (charges, lawsuits, jail time) for their actions. Briefly summarize the case and explain what went wrong.
