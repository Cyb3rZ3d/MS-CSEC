# Visualization Tasks

## Clustered column chart

This chart displays the comparison of different categories using vertical bars, making it easy to compare values across categories. For example, it can be used to compare the average Claim Amount by Policy Type.

## Donut chart

This chart shows the proportion of categories as segments of a circle, providing a visual representation of parts-to-whole relationships. For instance, it can illustrate the distribution of Claim Status across different Policy Types.

## Stacked column chart

This chart displays multiple data series stacked vertically in columns, allowing for comparison of total values and individual contributions within categories. It can be used to show the total Claim Amount by Hospital Type, with each segment representing different Policy Types.

## Interactive dashboard "Slicer"

This interactive element allows users to filter data dynamically, enabling a more focused analysis of specific subsets of the data. For example, users can filter claims by Hospital Rating or Policy Holder Income to analyze specific trends.

# Throught-Provoking Question:

Hospital ratings and policyholder income can greatly affect the time it takes to process claims. Hospitals with higher ratings often have more efficient administrative systems, which can lead to faster claim submissions and approvals. On the other hand, hospitals with lower ratings may experience delays due to issues with documentation and communication. Similarly, policyholders with higher incomes may have better access to resources and support, resulting in quicker claim resolutions. In contrast, lower-income policyholders might face difficulties in providing the necessary documentation, leading to longer processing times.

To use these insights effectively, insurance companies can prioritize claims from higher-rated hospitals and offer additional support to lower-rated hospitals to improve their processes. Creating targeted assistance programs for lower-income policyholders can help them navigate the claims process more efficiently. Additionally, predictive analytics can be used to identify potential delays based on hospital ratings and policyholder income, allowing for proactive measures such as assigning dedicated case managers to complex cases. By addressing these factors, insurance companies can enhance overall efficiency, reduce processing times, and improve customer satisfaction.
