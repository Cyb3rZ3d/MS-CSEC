# Part 1: About You

<br>

1. Preferred Name 

    - What is your nickname or preferred way to be addressed?

            Ruben is fine.

2. Background:

    - What is your major, and what interests you about penetration testing?
    
            - MS Cyber Security

            - My professional interest are in penetration testing and or working as a security analyst.  

    - Have you had any experience performing penetration testing or ethical hacking? If so, briefly describe it.

            My only experience has been collegiately in Security Tools 1 and 2 performing a white and gray box pentest using GCP and docker containers.  
            

3. Career Goals :

    - What do you hope to achieve in cybersecurity, and do you see penetration testing as part of your long-term career?

            I look forward to becoming more experienced and confident performing pentest.   My long-term goal is to fully immerse myself in the cyber as a pentester using my skills in the corporate sector and freelance.  

            I currently hold CompTIA Sec+, CySA+, PenTest+, and CASP+. I am looking to garner as much knowledge and practical expereince with the hopes to study and prepare for the CISSP and OSCP.  


4. Technical Skills:

    - List any tools, platforms, or scripting languages you’ve used related to penetration testing. If you’re new, that’s okay... just let me know.

            GCP, Kali, Python, Nmap, TCP dump, Wireshark, Metasploit, OpenVPN, Burp Suite, WPscan, wfuzz, Docker, 

5. Learning Expectations:
    - What do you hope to learn or achieve in this course? Are there specific attack methodologies or tools you want to like, check out?

            I look forward to learning everything I can in this class. This is a professional pathway interest I have.

# Part 2: Penetration Testing Basics

1. The Purpose of Penetration Testing:
    
    - In your own words, describe why organizations conduct penetration tests. What role does penetration testing play in an organization’s security strategy?

            Why organizations conduct pentest is to test for vulnerabilities against potential attacks at the physical, network, hardware, and application vectors of infrastructure.  

            The role the organization should be to identify such vulnerabilities within the company that could threaten the impact of loss of financial burdens or loss of data to potential customers or patients.


2. The Phases of a Penetration Test:
    
    - List the phases of a penetration test (I generally teach 5, but you tell me what you think). Choose one phase and briefly explain why it is critical to the success of the test.

            Planning and preparation
            Recon
            Scanning and Enumeration
            Exploitation
            Post-Exploitation
            Reporting
            Remediation and Retesting
            Lessons Learned

            As a pentester the Planning and prep phase to me is the most critical.  Why? Well it's important to gather all the details of the system that is getting pentested.  Permissions, signatures from appropriate personnel need to be had, identifying what systems need to be tested against based of the type of pentest.


3. Recent Penetration Test Scenario:
    
    - Research and summarize a real-world example of a penetration test or ethical hacking scenario (e.g., a red team tabletop engagement or simulated phishing attack). Include:

        ```
        Googled "Penetration Testing case studies".  Randomly chose a non-sponsored link from "PurpleSec".
        ```

        - What was the goal of the test?

                The goal of the test was to assess the internal network security and evaluate the impact on sensitive data.
        
        - What vulnerabilities were discovered?

                Vulnerabilities discovered were:
                
                1. Over-privileged Service/User Accounts
                2. LLMNR/NetBIOS-NS Spoofing
                3. SMB Signing Disabled

        
    - What impact did the test have on improving the organization’s security?

            1. Remediation of identified vulnerabiliies

                - Fixed the over-privilege accounts implementing least privelege
                - LLMR and NetBIOS were diabaled.

            2. Six weeks after the first assessments a secondary assessment was completed and the vulnerabilities from the first assessment were resolved and fixed. 


4. Tools of the Trade:

    - If you had to choose one tool to conduct a penetration test, what would it be and why? (Examples: Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Splunk, Shodan, Nessus, etc.)

            I don't think this question can be easily answered.  I'd use Nmap as a basic pentest tool to use without getting to involved with multiple tools that would involve a full pentest. 


5. Critical Thinking:

    - Imagine you are performing a penetration test on a small business. What is one unconventional attack vector you might explore, and why could it be effective?

            The needle in the hay stack - the most easiest and most unconventional vector would be dumpster diving.  This could possibly hold plentiful good information to a potential tester as people are the worst persons to insecurely write credentials on notepads or just other sensitive information on applications or systems.
