# The Case of the Compromised Network

Weight: 20% of final grade

## Covered Topics:
- Advanced Reconnaissance (Week 2)
- Vulnerability Analysis (Week 3)
- Exploitation Fundamentals (Week 4)

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will conduct a two-part, hands-on penetration testing engagement focusing on both a real-world domain (xytify.net) and a personal network you have explicit permission to test. Your goal is to apply advanced reconnaissance techniques, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation fundamentals to identify and document security weaknesses.

You will deliver a penetration test report detailing your findings, methodologies, and potential mitigations.



# Part 1: External Network Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Analysis

You are tasked with conducting an external reconnaissance, vulnerability analysis, and limited exploitation of the following hosts on the xytify.net domain:

    au.xytify.net (Australia)
    jp.xytify.net (Japan)
    za.xytify.net (South Africa)
    cl.xytify.net (Chile)
    uk.xytify.net (United Kingdom)


## Tasks:

- Reconnaissance (Week 2)

    - Use OSINT techniques (e.g., Shodan, Censys, WHOIS, subdomain enumeration) to gather intelligence about these hosts.
    - Perform active network scanning (e.g., Nmap, Masscan) to identify open ports and services.
    - Identify DNS records and certificate transparency logs for additional insights.

- Vulnerability Analysis (Week 3)

    - Utilize vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, Nuclei) to detect security issues.
    - Manually validate high-risk findings through research and exploitation frameworks like Metasploit or ExploitDB.
    - Categorize vulnerabilities by severity (CVSS score) and determine exploitability.

- Exploitation (Week 4 - Limited & Ethical)

    - Where applicable, conduct safe proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits that do not disrupt services.
    - Example: Perform credential stuffing, default password testing, directory traversal, or non-invasive SQLi/command injection tests if justified.
    - DO NOT: Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) or any attack that disrupts service.
    - Provide screenshots and logs from your tests to verify findings.

# Part 2: Internal Network Analysis on a Personal Network

- Choose a personal network where you have explicit permission to operate. Examples:

    - Your home network (Wi-Fi router, IoT devices, personal computers).
    - A lab environment (virtual machines, isolated test networks).
    - A companyâ€™s test environment (if they allow security research).

## Tasks:

- Map the Network & Identify Assets

    - Use Nmap, ARP scanning, and Wireshark to discover devices.
    - Identify the router, primary hosts, IoT devices, and any unauthorized devices.

- Analyze Network Security & Vulnerabilities

    - Scan for misconfigurations (e.g., weak encryption, open services, outdated firmware).
    - Evaluate Wi-Fi security (WPA2/3, default passwords, MAC filtering, WPS vulnerabilities).
    - If applicable, assess firewall rules and intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) alerts.

- Attempt Controlled Exploits

    - Try packet sniffing for plaintext credentials.
    - Attempt ARP spoofing or MITM attacks (on an isolated lab network).
    - If using IoT devices, investigate default credentials, open ports, and firmware vulnerabilities.

# Deliverable: Penetration Testing Report

Your final submission should be a professional-style penetration test report covering both parts.

## Report Sections:

- Executive Summary (1 - 1.5 single spaced pages)

    - High-level overview of findings.
    - Most critical vulnerabilities and suggested mitigations.
    - ***Graduate students should include an analysis of at least 2 of the xytify.net country laws related to these activities and enumerate in a separate 2 page document (1 page per item).***

- Methodology

    - Tools used, reconnaissance steps, scanning approach.

- Findings (Both Network Analyses)

    - Detailed breakdown of vulnerabilities (per host & personal network).
    - Screenshots, logs, and PoC exploit results.

- Risk Assessment

    - Impact and likelihood analysis of vulnerabilities.

- Mitigation Strategies

    - Recommended security enhancements.

- Appendix

    - Raw scans, scripts, additional data.
