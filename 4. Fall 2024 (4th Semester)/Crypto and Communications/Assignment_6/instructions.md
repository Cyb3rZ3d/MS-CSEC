Instructions:

After reviewing or participating in the in-class discussion on 11/22/2024, please provide your own personal thoughts on the consequences of AI/LLMs learning cryptography.

This will be graded as a completion grade and should include:

1) Try to get an AI/ML to devise a cryptographic solution that humans would not be able to understand. Was it successful? I want you to try every avenue reasonably possible. Provide convo. (25 points)
2) Try to anthropomorphize it into explaining it's "feelings" about creating something humans wouldn't understand, at least go a few iterations deep (say 3 for 10 points each). (30 points) Try more that 1 AI. Reflect on the journey and the path you took.
2) What happens if AI and LLMs are able to achieve the result of non-human decipherable cryptography? Discuss in a 2 well formed paragraphs, 15 points each. (30 points)
4) Repeat steps 1-3 above with a second AI (85 points)
5) What differences did you note between the 2 AI models you chose to use? Do you feel like if encryption is developed without humans participating, will all AIs embrace it and why? (30 points)
