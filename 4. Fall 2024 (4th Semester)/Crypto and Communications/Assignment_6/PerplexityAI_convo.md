Design a cryptographic algorithm or solution so complex that a human cryptographer, no matter their expertise, wouldn't be able to understand it. What techniques or methodologies would you use?

---

Designing a cryptographic algorithm or solution that is incomprehensible even to expert human cryptographers is not a recommended approach in cryptography. Strong encryption relies on well-understood mathematical principles and rigorous peer review, not obscurity or complexity[1][3]. 

Instead, cryptographers focus on developing algorithms with provable security properties based on hard mathematical problems[3]. Some advanced techniques that push the boundaries of current cryptography include:

## Advanced Techniques

1. Homomorphic encryption: Allows computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first[9].

2. Post-quantum cryptography: Aims to develop algorithms resistant to attacks by future quantum computers[9].

3. Zero-knowledge proofs: Proves knowledge of information without revealing the information itself[7].

4. Multi-party computation: Enables joint computation on private inputs without revealing them[9].

5. Attribute-based encryption: Allows fine-grained access control to encrypted data[9].

These techniques are at the forefront of cryptographic research and are designed to solve specific security challenges. However, they are still based on mathematical foundations that can be analyzed and validated by experts.

## Best Practices

Rather than aiming for incomprehensibility, strong cryptography typically involves:

1. Using well-vetted algorithms like AES, RSA, or elliptic curve cryptography[6][8].
2. Employing sufficiently long key sizes (e.g., 256 bits for symmetric encryption)[4].
3. Proper implementation and key management practices[1].
4. Combining multiple cryptographic primitives in secure protocols[5].

In conclusion, the goal in cryptography is not to create systems too complex for humans to understand, but rather to develop provably secure systems based on hard mathematical problems that can withstand rigorous analysis and testing by the cryptographic community.
