Objective: Create a 10 to 15 minute presentation that showcases your understanding of a specific cryptographic concept. You may record your presentation using Zoom, PowerPoint-based recording, or present live. This is an opportunity to demonstrate both a deep theoretical understanding and practical insights into the chosen topic.

Guidelines:
1. Topic Selection: Choose a topic either covered in this course or something else you find intriguing within the cryptography domain. You should provide a deep dive into this topic, exploring both practical applications and theoretical foundations.
  - Examples: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Post-Quantum Cryptography, Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Securing Communications, etc.

2. Mathematical Basis: Ensure your presentation includes the mathematical basis of the chosen topic. This doesn't need to be exhaustive but should cover the essential mathematical principles so that someone with a basic understanding of cryptography can follow.
  - For instance, if discussing ECC, include how elliptic curves work over finite fields and why they are suitable for cryptographic purposes.

3. Presentation Content: Your presentation should include the following elements:
  - Introduction to the Topic: Provide a brief overview, including why this topic is significant in cryptography today.
  - Mathematical Foundation: Explain key mathematical concepts related to the topic, focusing on clarity and conciseness.
  - Applications and Use Cases: Highlight where and how the cryptographic method is used in the real world.
  - Challenges and Future Prospects: Discuss any limitations, challenges, or upcoming advancements related to the topic.

4. Visuals and Clarity: Use visuals like diagrams, graphs, and example problems to make complex ideas easier to grasp. Keep slides simple and visually engaging to ensure the audience can follow along without getting overwhelmed.

5. Recording and Submission: The presentation can be pre-recorded or delivered live. If recording, ensure both audio and visuals are clear, and keep it within the 10-minute timeframe. Submit the recording by the specified deadline.


Assessment Criteria:

- Clarity of Explanation (30 points): Did the presentation clearly explain the chosen topic, including the mathematics behind it?
