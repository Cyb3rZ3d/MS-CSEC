This assignment is designed to have y'all demonstrate the core concepts of blockchain technology by having you create your own cryptocurrency. This can be done as either a implementation project or as a theoretical write-up, depending on your preference.

Option 1: Technical Project 

1. Blockchain Setup (40 points) 
  
  - Create a simple blockchain using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Document the steps taken in the development process and provide a brief explanation of how the blockchain maintains a distributed ledger. Lots of free public examples out there for this.

2. Currency Design (30 points) 
  
  - Design and implement the core features of your cryptocurrency (e.g., naming the coin, creating a mining mechanism, setting a maximum coin supply). Explain how transactions are handled within your blockchain. Provide screenshots of this stuff to demo cryptogenesis.

3. Security Features (30 points) 
  
  - Implement and describe basic security features, such as hashing algorithms and consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work or Proof of Stake). Explain why these security measures are essential for blockchain integrity.

4. Transaction Demo (25 points) 
  
  - Demonstrate a simple transaction between two accounts on your blockchain. Provide screenshots and a detailed description of how the transaction process works.

5. Challenges and Reflections (25 points) 
  
  - Write a short reflection (300-400 words) on the challenges you faced while developing your cryptocurrency and how you overcame them. Include thoughts on scalability and real-world implementation.
