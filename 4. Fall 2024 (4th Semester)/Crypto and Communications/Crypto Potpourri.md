2. ***What 2 things stood out to you the most from her lecture, any why? If she were alive today, what would she be talking about, and why, based on your experience? (50 points)***

    1. As a Navy veteran, I liked her introduction as using her hat as her identifier being a naval officer. Her witty banter about getting confused for either a pilot or flight attendant. Associating her identifier comment's made me think and what I think she was attempting to do as a message to the audience is that everything has an identifier.  

    Associates having a lousy job to maintain transportation as a whole to ho


Failed to value incorrect data informaiton.

She clearly identifies the lack of lifecycle of systems when she was talking about how to take an island.  Having to plan for the systems that will be needed in the futur and not the now.  

The persistance of never stop asking even when told no when attempting to present or offer a solution for change or having a new concept.
