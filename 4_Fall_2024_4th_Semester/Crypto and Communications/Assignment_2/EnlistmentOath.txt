The following is the oath took when I first enlisted into the U.S. Navy:

The Oath of Enlistment (for enlisted): 
"I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God."

As a member of the U.S. Navy, we also had our Sailor's Creed we all needed to know and recite:

"I am a United States Sailor.

I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America
and I will obey the orders of those appointed over me.

I represent the fighting spirit of the Navy and those who have gone before me
to defend freedom and democracy around the world.

I proudly serve my country's Navy combat team with Honor, Courage and Commitment.

I am committed to excellence and the fair treatment of all."

In addition to learning or naval traditions, we were introduced to and had to learn our Navy song 'Anchors Aweigh':

[Verse 1]
Stand Navy out to sea,
Fight our battle cry;
We'll never change our course,
So vicious foe steer shy-y-y-y.
Roll out the TNT,
Anchors Aweigh.
Sail on to victory
And sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray!

[Verse 2]
Anchors Aweigh, my boys,
Anchors Aweigh.
Farewell to foreign shores,
We sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay.
Through our last night ashore,
Drink to the foam,
Until we meet once more.
Here's wishing you a happy voyage home.

[Verse 3]
Blue of the mighty deep:
Gold of God's great sun.
Let these our colors be
Till all of time be done, done, done, done.
On seven seas we learn
Navy's stern call:
Faith, courage, service true,
With honor, over honor, over all.
