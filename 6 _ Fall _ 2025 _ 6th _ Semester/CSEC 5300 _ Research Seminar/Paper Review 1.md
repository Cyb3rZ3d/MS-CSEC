## 3rd Pass

This pass requires great attention to detail. You should
identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would
present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual
with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and
presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely
add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you
should also jot down ideas for future work.
