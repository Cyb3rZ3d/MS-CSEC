# Task 3: .boto file content with the 'encryption_key=..........' and 'decryption_key1=........' update

After getting the only screenshot i got for completing Task 3, I realized i didn't capture all the images needed and I incidently closed my browser losing all the work.  In attempting to redo the lab, I tried to get back to Task 3, but kept getting inundated with Task 2 SSH failures that plagued Thursday class.  I attempted to delete and create new instances waiting for the creation of the instance before starting the SSH, but was still unsuccessful with opening a SSH screen.   


- the result of # 8 command, 'gsutil cp gs://$BUCKET_NAME/setup2.html ./'

***NOTE: After getting the only screenshot i got for completing Task 3, I realized i didn't capture all the images needed and I incidently closed my browser losing all the work.  In attempting to redo the lab a few times, I tried to get back to Task 3, but kept getting inundated with Task 2 SSH failures that plagued Thursdays class.  I attempted to delete and create IAM service accounts and new instances waiting for the creation of the instance before starting the SSH, but was still unsuccessful with opening a SSH screen. Throughout the process of trying to restart the lab, I have now depleted my credits down to 39.***
