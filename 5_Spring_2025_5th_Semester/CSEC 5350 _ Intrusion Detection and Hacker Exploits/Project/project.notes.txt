In this assignment, you gonna both attack and defend a cloud-hosted virtual machine you control. You will first act as the Red Team, launching a simulated offensive campaign. Then, you will pivot to the Blue Team, analyzing the attack, tracing its impact using a functional SIEM, and proposing mitigations based on real-world CVEs.

You are responsible for building:

1. One cloud-hosted Linux VM using AWS

2. One supplemental data source for SIEM ingestion-
    - A Windows 10/11 machine (physical or VM)
    - A Linux container running syslog-producing services
    - Or another “fun” logging target (e.g., a honeypot, Zeek sensor)

        Notes: Your SIEM must ingest logs from both systems.

# Red Team Phase:

## Tasks:

Enumerate and identify attack surfaces on your own cloud VM.
Choose at least three CVEs (with CVSS scoring) that affect a service or software running on your VM. Justify its choice based on exploitability and impact.
Craft and execute an exploit (public or custom script) that simulates unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
Document TTPs using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
Artifacts to include:

Nmap/service enumeration results
Proof-of-concept (PoC) code or execution results
Screenshots or terminal logs showing success
MITRE mapping and CVE summary

# Blue Team Phase

## Tasks:

Configure a basic SIEM (examples: Splunk, ELK Stack, Graylog, Security Onion) to collect logs from both the cloud VM and your secondary source.
Implement logging/monitoring agents to capture the data.
Detect the Red Team activity using:
Timeline correlation
Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
Signature or behavioral detection
Identify the exploited CVE and assess its risk using CVSS.
Artifacts to include:

SIEM dashboard screenshots
Excerpted logs or alerts from both sources
CVE summary with calculated CVSS base score and justification
Defensive remediation steps

# Deliverable Format

Submit one PDF report that includes:

1. Red Team Section

Attack plan and CVE justification
Tools used and attack walkthrough
MITRE ATT&CK mapping
Screenshots/logs showing access or exploitation

2. Blue Team Section

SIEM architecture diagram
Log agent configurations and integration steps
IOC and alert examples from the SIEM
Risk analysis of the exploited CVE
Timeline of detection and incident response

3. Reflection (1 pagish MAX)
